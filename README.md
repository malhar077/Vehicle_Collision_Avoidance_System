#  Vehicle Collision Avoidance System (Linux IPC & System Calls)

##  Overview

This project simulates a **Vehicle Collision Avoidance System** using Linux system programming concepts.
Multiple vehicle processes communicate through **shared memory**, while a central controller continuously monitors vehicle positions and detects potential collisions.

The system mimics real-world behavior:

* Warning when vehicles come too close
* Automatic driver action (speed reduction)
* Delay using signals (reaction time simulation)
* Collision detection if danger persists
* Logging of all events for analysis

This project demonstrates **process control, multithreading, signals, and IPC mechanisms** in a clean and modular way.

## Signal Reference

| Signal  | Purpose                                      |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SIGALRM | Introduces delay before confirming collision |
| SIGTERM | Stops system after collision                 |
| SIGINT  | Manual termination (Ctrl + C)                |

##  Log System

All events are stored in:

```
log/vehicle_log.txt
```

Example:

```
[10:21:05] WARNING: Vehicles getting close
[10:21:05] ACTION: Speed reduced
[10:21:09] COLLISION: Vehicles 1 & 2
[10:21:10] SYSTEM STOPPED
```

## Sample Output

```
--- Vehicle Data ---
Vehicle 1 → position=0 speed=50
Vehicle 2 → position=50 speed=50
Vehicle 3 → position=100 speed=30

--- Vehicle Data ---
Vehicle 1 → position=10 speed=50
Vehicle 2 → position=40 speed=50
Vehicle 3 → position=102 speed=30

⚠️ WARNING: Vehicles 1 & 2 close  
🚗 Driver Action: Reducing speed!

--- Vehicle Data ---
Vehicle 1 → position=19 speed=40
Vehicle 2 → position=31 speed=40
Vehicle 3 → position=104 speed=30

--- Vehicle Data ---
Vehicle 1 → position=27 speed=40
Vehicle 2 → position=23 speed=40
Vehicle 3 → position=106 speed=30

🚨 COLLISION DETECTED (1 & 2)  
🚗 System stopped due to collision!
